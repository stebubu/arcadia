# Introduction

Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, posing significant risks to cities and regions. The **Climate Risk Assessment Toolbox** provides a structured approach for evaluating climate-related risks and identifying opportunities for **Nature-Based Solutions (NbS)**. This toolbox is designed to guide local governments, planners, and stakeholders through a step-by-step risk assessment process.
