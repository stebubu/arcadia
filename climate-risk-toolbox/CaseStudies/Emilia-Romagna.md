# Emilia-Romagna (Italy) Case Study

**Context:**  
Emilia-Romagna is a region in northern Italy known for its diverse landscapes, including urban centers and agricultural zones. The region is exposed to multiple climate risks, such as floods and heatwaves.

**Risk Assessment:**  
- **Flooding:** Flood hazard maps indicate high risk along river systems.  
- **Heatwaves:** Urban centers face increased temperatures and heat stress.

**Solutions Implemented:**  
- *River Restoration:* Reconnecting floodplains and enhancing natural buffers.  
- *Urban Greening:* Tree planting, green roofs, and the creation of parks.  

**Outcomes & Lessons:**  
Early projects have improved resilience, reduced flood peaks, and lowered urban temperatures. Continuous monitoring and community involvement are crucial for long-term success.
